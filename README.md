# About the project
<img src="POSTER//POSTER.jpg" width="1500">

**Student Service Zone (HandinHand)**
is based on two applications. a web application and
an android application. Combined, these two applications will provide a social 
solidarity platform for students to show the spirit of kindness and help each other. Both applications 
will offer the same functionality and they are both connected via a RESTful api to ensure the consistency 
of data so the user can reach it no matter what device is being used. Mainly, HandinHand has 4 core resources 
which are items, hand made products, services and events and two types of users a normal user and a trusted user.

## My journey
Before i work on this project my knowledge in android is:(RecyclerView, Room, SQLite).

And after we completed the project i'd love to mention my knowledge now and what i could do with it:
-Retrofit (I can Deal with requests, responses, Headers, Upload files to the server and Download files from the server).
- ViewModel and LiveData (i can deal with MVVM very well and now i read about Repository design pattern to use it with MVVM).
- WorkManager.
- Ask the permissions as [best practices guidlines](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/usage-notes)
- ConstraintLayout (and now i learn the new version MotionLayout).
- Material Design Component (MDC).
- NavigationComponent (as you see in the picture of the Navigation Editor the complex of our project and also i used some shared element animations with it).
- Pusher to deal with runtime events.
- some other libraries as: Picasso, Glide, ShapeOfView, PhotoView and others.
- and also some addition knowledge that i didn't use it in the project but i learned it: Kotlin, Notification, RXJava and Paging library and more...

**note** that the code might be not perfect we coded the project while we are learning a new 
technologies or new libraries to use it so you may find a garbage code ðŸ˜¥ and after we finished 
it or after we learned  it in the right way we find it's not good but we put it in our future work to 
refactore the whole project in both the backend and the android.
